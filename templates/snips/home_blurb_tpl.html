<h3>Weclome to Site Builder</h3>
<p><em>probably the simplest site builder on the planet today</em></p>
<p>And how does it work? I hear you ask, its simple I say.</p>
<p>Using a revolutionary, new, genetically modified pygmy shrew, based engine.</p>

<p>Well sadly perhaps its not shrew powered, But it is small,
 the patently simple static site builder compiles a static site from a set of html based templates.</p>
